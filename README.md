# Agri Products — E-commerce Starter

A lightweight React + Vite e-commerce clone for agricultural products. This is a minimal, ready-to-run storefront prototype you can extend and deploy.

## Features

- Product listing and detail views
- Client-side cart with mock checkout
- Simple, responsive UI

## Quick start

1. Install dependencies

```bash
cd agri-products-app
npm install
```

2. Run dev server

```bash
npm run dev
```

3. Open your browser at the URL printed by Vite (usually http://localhost:5173)

## Build for production

```bash
npm run build
npm run preview
```

## Next steps to make "launch-ready"

- Add user accounts and authentication (e.g., NextAuth)
- Add a backend API for inventory, orders, and payments
- Integrate real payment gateway (Stripe/PayPal/Razorpay)
- Add admin dashboard for product management
- Add tests, accessibility checks, and CI/CD pipeline

If you want, I can:
- integrate a Node + Express API and a database
- add Stripe checkout integration
- prepare deployment config for Vercel or AWS
